      Outside of my startup all of my professional software experience has been
      in defense and intelligence contracting. Despite building web applications
      using JS frameworks like Angular and Vue in those roles, those
      applications are not publically hosted. This makes sharing samples of my
      work with potential employers impossible. For that reason, I've decided to
      create a site where people could get a sense of who I am and what I'm
      capable of. I built this site using some of my favorite frontend
      technologies: Vue, Vuetify, D3, and RxJS.
