        For a formal breakdown of roles and responsibilities please use the
        contact page to request a resume. What follows is narrative description
        of my career thus far as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        While serving out my final tour as an NROTC instructor at Boston
        University, I decided to pursue a graduate degree in computer science.
        Working full-time, attending classes, and completing assignments took
        its toll, but it was worth it. When I left the Navy in January of 2017,
        I was in a position to apply for software engineering jobs. We moved out
        to Salt Lake City where my wife had a one-year judicial clerkship. In
        February, I joined the GUI team at L3 Communications Systems working on
        an Angular frontend and Node API.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we moved out to Salt Lake, we had no idea if we would stay when the
        year was up. A few months into our time in Utah, we decided to return to
        the east coast after the clerkship. Knowing that I wasn't going to build
        a career at L3, I took an opportunity to join my cousin in a startup
        venture. We attended the Y Combinator Startup School and got to work.
        The startup didn't pan out for us, but I learned more about building web
        applications in that year out of shear necessity than I would have
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sole developer, especially coming from a military background, the
        thing I really missed was collaboration. While I was in constant
        communication with my startup partners, I was solo coding and I know now
        that is not something I prefer. A month after we moved to DC at the
        beginning of 2018, I accepted a position as a software engineer with
        SOSi. Over the next two and half years I grew into a full-stack
        developer working on the virtualization layer, DBs, APIs, devops, and
        becoming a tech lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October, I decided that I was ready for a change and with the
        election around the corner there was a compelling volunteer position for
        me to jump to. When I left SOSi I went to work as a volunteer for the
        Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee building data processing
        pipelines and visualizations to track rejected vote by mail ballots and
        get them fixed in time for them to count. Since election day I've been
        working on this site and my continuing education goals. I've also been
        enjoying my first sabbatical since I joined the Navy back in 2005, but
        if you're reading this then perhaps I've started looking for work again.
